The closer the p-value is to 1, the higher the likelihood that it came our null hypothesis is true. In order to reject a null hypothesis, the p-value must meet a particular threshold. This threshold, known as the α (alpha) or Type I error rate, varies by application but is usually 0.05 or lower. A p-value at or below this threshold has only 0.05 or lower chance of coming from a dataset reflective of the null hypothesis, and so acts as evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative."
